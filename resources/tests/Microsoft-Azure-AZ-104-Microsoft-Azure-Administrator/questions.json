The Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant uses a domain named Litware.onmicrosoft.com. The tenant uses the P1 pricing tier. The network contains an Active Directory forest named Litware.com. All domain controllers are configured as DNS servers and host the Litware.com DNS zone. Litware has finance, human resources, sales, research, and information technology departments. Each department has an organizational unit (OU) that contains all the accounts of that respective department. All the user accounts have the department attribute set to their respective department. New users are added frequently. Litware.com contains a user named User1. All the offices connect by using private links. Litware has data centers in the Montreal and Seattle offices. Each data center has a firewall that can be configured as a VPN device. All infrastructure servers are virtualized. The virtualization environment contains the servers in the following table. The network security team implements several network security groups (NSGs). Litware plans to implement the following changes: Deploy Azure ExpressRoute to the Montreal office. Migrate the virtual machines hosted on Server1 and Server2 to Azure. Synchronize on-premises Active Directory to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Migrate App1 and App2 to two Azure web apps named webApp1 and WebApp2. Litware must meet the following technical requirements: Ensure that WebApp1 can adjust the number of instances automatically based on the load and can scale up to five instance*. Ensure that VM3 can establish outbound connections over TCP port 8080 to the applications servers in the Montreal office. Ensure that routing information is exchanged automatically between Azure and the routers in the Montreal office. Enable Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the users in the finance department only. Ensure that webapp2.azurewebsites.net can be accessed by using the name app2.Litware.com. Connect the New Your office to VNet1 over the Internet by using an encrypted connection. Create a workflow to send an email message when the settings of VM4 are modified. Create a custom Azure role named Role1 that is based on the Reader role. Minimize costs whenever possible. You need to implement Role1.

You recently provisioned an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. Network Infrastructure Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that office. Each office has a dedicated connection to the Internet. Each office has several link load balancers that provide access to the servers. Active Directory Issue Several users in humongousinsurance.com have UPNs that contain special characters. You suspect that some of the characters are unsupported in Azure AD. Licensing Issue You attempt to assign a license in Azure to several users and receive the following error message: &#x27;Licenses not assigned. License agreement failed for one user.&#x27; You verify that the Azure subscription has the available licenses. Requirements Planned Changes Humongous Insurance plans to open a new office in Paris. The Paris office will contain 1,000 users who will be hired during the next 12 months. All the resources used by the Paris office users will be hosted in Azure. Planned Azure AD Infrastructure The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD. All client computers in the Paris office will be joined to an Azure AD domain. Planned Azure Networking Infrastructure You plan to create the following networking resources in a resource group named All_Resources: Default Azure system routes that will be the only routes used to route traffic. A virtual network named Paris-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet1 and Subnet2. A virtual network named ClientResources-VNet that will contain one subnet named ClientSubnet. A virtual network named AllOffices-VNet that will contain two subnets named Subnet3 and Subnet4 You plan to enable peering between Paris-VNet and AllOffices-VNet. You will enable the Use remote gateways setting for the Paris-VNet peerings. You plan to create a private DNS zone named humongousinsurance.local and set the registration network to the ClientResources-VNet virtual network. Planned Azure Computer Infrastructure Each subnet will contain several virtual machines that will run either Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, or Red Hat Linux. Department Requirements Humongous Insurance identifies the following requirements for the company&#x27;s departments: Web administrators will deploy Azure web apps for the marketing department. Each web app will be added to a separate resource group. The initial configuration of the web apps will be identical. The web administrators have permission to deploy web apps to resource groups. During the testing phase, auditors in the finance department must be able to review all Azure costs from the past week. Authentication Requirements Users in the Miami office must use Azure Active Directory Seamless Single Sign-on (Azure AD Seamless SSO) when accessing resources in Azure. DRAG DROP You need to prepare the environment to ensure that the web administrators can deploy the web apps as quickly as possible. Which three actions should you perform in sequence?

Contoso products are manufactured by using blueprint files that the company authors and maintains. Existing Environment Currently, Contoso uses multiple types of servers for business operations, including the following: File servers. Domain controllers. Microsoft SQL Server servers Your network contains an Active Directory forest named contoso.com. All servers and client computers are joined to Active Directory. You have a public-facing application named App1. App1 is comprised of the following three tiers: A SQL database. A web front end. A processing middle tier Each tier is comprised of five virtual machines. Users access the web front end by using HTTPS only. Requirements Planned Changes Contoso plans to implement the following changes to the infrastructure: \u2013 Move all the tiers of App1 to Azure. \u2013 Move the existing product blueprint files to Azure Blob storage. \u2013 Create a hybrid directory to support an upcoming Microsoft Office 365 migration project. Technical Requirements Contoso must meet the following technical requirements: Move all the virtual machines for App1 to Azure. Minimize the number of open ports between the App1 tiers. Ensure that all the virtual machines for App1 are protected by backups. Copy the blueprint files to Azure over the Internet. Ensure that the blueprint files are stored in the archive storage tier. Ensure that partner access to the blueprint files is secured and temporary. Prevent user passwords or hashes of passwords from being stored in Azure. Use unmanaged standard storage for the hard disks of the virtual machines. Ensure that when users join devices to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), the users use a mobile phone to verify their identity. Minimize administrative effort whenever possible. User Requirements Contoso identifies the following requirements for users: Ensure that only users who are part of a group named Pilot can join devices to Azure AD. Designate a new user named Admin1 as the service administrator of the Azure subscription. Admin1 must receive email alerts regarding service outages. Ensure that a new user named User3 can create network objects for the Azure subscription. You need to implement a backup solution for App1 after the application is moved.
