        "question": "Fabrikam, Inc is a manufacturing company that has a main office in New York and a branch office in Seattle. The on-premises network contains servers that run Windows Server as shown in the following table. DC1 hosts all the operation master roles. VM1 and VM2 are connected to the internet. WEB1 and WEB2 run an Internet Information Services (IIS) web app named Webapp1. The New York and Seattle offices are connected by using redundant WAN links. The client computers in each office get IP addresses from their local DHCP server. DHCP1 contains a scope named Scope1 that has addresses for the New York office, DHCP2 contains a scope named Scope2 that has addresses for the Seattle office. The network contains a single on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain named corp.falbrikam.com. Currently, all the service accounts use individual domain user accounts. All domain controllers have the DNS Server role installed and host a copy of the Active Directory integrated DNS zone of corp.fabrikam.com. The corp.fabrikam.com AD DS domain syncs with an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. The corp.fabrikam.com domain contains the organizational units (OUs) and custom Group Policy Objects (GPOs) shown in the following table. Fabrikam identifies the following planned changes: Create a single Azure subscription named Sub1 that will contain a single Azure virtual network named Vnet1. Replace the WAN links between the Seattle and New York offices by using Azure Virtual WAN and FxpressRoute. Both on premises offices will be connected to Vnet1 by using ExpressRoute. Create three Azure file shares named newyorkfiles, seattlefiles, and companyfiles. Create a domain controller named dc3.corp.fabrikam.com in Vnet1. Deploy an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool to Vnet1. The Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts will be hybrid Azure AD-joined. License all servers for Microsoft Defender for servers. Use Azure Policy to enforce configuration management policies on the servers in Azure and on-premises. Fabrikam identifies the following networking requirements: Implement Virtual WAN and ensure that all the network traffic between the sites uses Virtual WAN. All communications must occur over ExpressRoute. If a DHCP server fails, ensure that the client computers can continue to receive their dynamic IP address and renew their existing lease. Ensure that the resources in Vnet1 can resolve the names of the on-premises servers in the corp.fabrikam.com domain. Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements: Apply GPO4 to the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts. Ensure that Azure Virtual Desktop user sessions lock after being idle for 10 minutes. Users must be able to control the lockout time manually from their client computer. Ensure that server administrators request approval before they can establish a Remote Desktop connection to an Azure virtual machine. If the request is approved, the connection must be established within two hours. Prevent user passwords from containing all or part of words that are based on the company name, such as Fab, f@br1kAm or fabr!|. Ensure that all instances of Webapp1 use the same service account. The password of the service account must change automatically every 30 days. Prevent domain controllers from directly contacting hosts on the internet. You need to configure the synchronization of Azure files to meet the following requirements: Ensure that seattlefiles syncs to FS2. Ensure that newyorkfiles syncs to FS1. Ensure that companyfiles syncs to both FS1 and FS2. You need to configure remote administration to meet the security requirements.

DHCP1 contains a scope named Scope1 that has addresses for the New York office, DHCP2 contains a scope named Scope2 that has addresses for the Seattle office. The network contains a single on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain named corp.falbrikam.com. Currently, all the service accounts use individual domain user accounts. All domain controllers have the DNS Server role installed and host a copy of the Active Directory integrated DNS zone of corp.fabrikam.com. The corp.fabrikam.com AD DS domain syncs with an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. The corp.fabrikam.com domain contains the organizational units (OUs) and custom Group Policy Objects (GPOs) shown in the following table. Fabrikam identifies the following planned changes: Create a single Azure subscription named Sub1 that will contain a single Azure virtual network named Vnet1. Replace the WAN links between the Seattle and New York offices by using Azure Virtual WAN and FxpressRoute. Both on premises offices will be connected to Vnet1 by using ExpressRoute. Create three Azure file shares named newyorkfiles, seattlefiles, and companyfiles. Create a domain controller named dc3.corp.fabrikam.com in Vnet1. Deploy an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool to Vnet1. The Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts will be hybrid Azure AD-joined. License all servers for Microsoft Defender for servers. Use Azure Policy to enforce configuration management policies on the servers in Azure and on-premises. Fabrikam identifies the following networking requirements: Implement Virtual WAN and ensure that all the network traffic between the sites uses Virtual WAN. All communications must occur over ExpressRoute. If a DHCP server fails, ensure that the client computers can continue to receive their dynamic IP address and renew their existing lease. Ensure that the resources in Vnet1 can resolve the names of the on-premises servers in the corp.fabrikam.com domain. Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements: Apply GPO4 to the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts. Ensure that Azure Virtual Desktop user sessions lock after being idle for 10 minutes. Users must be able to control the lockout time manually from their client computer. Ensure that server administrators request approval before they can establish a Remote Desktop connection to an Azure virtual machine. If the request is approved, the connection must be established within two hours. Prevent user passwords from containing all or part of words that are based on the company name, such as Fab, f@br1kAm or fabr!|. Ensure that all instances of Webapp1 use the same service account. The password of the service account must change automatically every 30 days. Prevent domain controllers from directly contacting hosts on the internet. You need to configure the synchronization of Azure files to meet the following requirements: Ensure that seattlefiles syncs to FS2. Ensure that newyorkfiles syncs to FS1. Ensure that companyfiles syncs to both FS1 and FS2. What should you implement for the deployment of DC3?  <br><img src='resources\\tests\\Microsoft-Azure-AZ-800-Windows-Server-Hybrid-Administrator\\images\\question7_16_17_19_22_29_45_1.jpg' alt='Question 16 part 1'> <br><img src='resources\\tests\\Microsoft-Azure-AZ-800-Windows-Server-Hybrid-Administrator\\images\\question7_16_17_19_22_29_45_2.jpg' alt='Question 16 part 2'>",

        "question": "Fabrikam, Inc is a manufacturing company that has a main office in New York and a branch office in Seattle. The on-premises network contains servers that run Windows Server as shown in the following table. DC1 hosts all the operation master roles. VM1 and VM2 are connected to the internet. WEB1 and WEB2 run an Internet Information Services (IIS) web app named Webapp1. The New York and Seattle offices are connected by using redundant WAN links. The client computers in each office get IP addresses from their local DHCP server. DHCP1 contains a scope named Scope1 that has addresses for the New York office, DHCP2 contains a scope named Scope2 that has addresses for the Seattle office. The network contains a single on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain named corp.falbrikam.com. Currently, all the service accounts use individual domain user accounts. All domain controllers have the DNS Server role installed and host a copy of the Active Directory integrated DNS zone of corp.fabrikam.com. The corp.fabrikam.com AD DS domain syncs with an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. The corp.fabrikam.com domain contains the organizational units (OUs) and custom Group Policy Objects (GPOs) shown in the following table. Fabrikam identifies the following planned changes: Create a single Azure subscription named Sub1 that will contain a single Azure virtual network named Vnet1. Replace the WAN links between the Seattle and New York offices by using Azure Virtual WAN and FxpressRoute. Both on premises offices will be connected to Vnet1 by using ExpressRoute. Create three Azure file shares named newyorkfiles, seattlefiles, and companyfiles. Create a domain controller named dc3.corp.fabrikam.com in Vnet1. Deploy an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool to Vnet1. The Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts will be hybrid Azure AD-joined. License all servers for Microsoft Defender for servers. Use Azure Policy to enforce configuration management policies on the servers in Azure and on-premises. Fabrikam identifies the following networking requirements: Implement Virtual WAN and ensure that all the network traffic between the sites uses Virtual WAN. All communications must occur over ExpressRoute. If a DHCP server fails, ensure that the client computers can continue to receive their dynamic IP address and renew their existing lease. Ensure that the resources in Vnet1 can resolve the names of the on-premises servers in the corp.fabrikam.com domain. Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements: Apply GPO4 to the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts. Ensure that Azure Virtual Desktop user sessions lock after being idle for 10 minutes. Users must be able to control the lockout time manually from their client computer. Ensure that server administrators request approval before they can establish a Remote Desktop connection to an Azure virtual machine. If the request is approved, the connection must be established within two hours. Prevent user passwords from containing all or part of words that are based on the company name, such as Fab, f@br1kAm or fabr!|. Ensure that all instances of Webapp1 use the same service account. The password of the service account must change automatically every 30 days. Prevent domain controllers from directly contacting hosts on the internet. You need to configure the synchronization of Azure files to meet the following requirements: Ensure that seattlefiles syncs to FS2. Ensure that newyorkfiles syncs to FS1. Ensure that companyfiles syncs to both FS1 and FS2. You are planning the implementation Azure Arc to support the planned changes. You need to configure the environment to support configuration management policies.

        "question": "Fabrikam, Inc is a manufacturing company that has a main office in New York and a branch office in Seattle. The on-premises network contains servers that run Windows Server as shown in the following table. DC1 hosts all the operation master roles. VM1 and VM2 are connected to the internet. WEB1 and WEB2 run an Internet Information Services (IIS) web app named Webapp1. The New York and Seattle offices are connected by using redundant WAN links. The client computers in each office get IP addresses from their local DHCP server. DHCP1 contains a scope named Scope1 that has addresses for the New York office, DHCP2 contains a scope named Scope2 that has addresses for the Seattle office. The network contains a single on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain named corp.falbrikam.com. Currently, all the service accounts use individual domain user accounts. All domain controllers have the DNS Server role installed and host a copy of the Active Directory integrated DNS zone of corp.fabrikam.com. The corp.fabrikam.com AD DS domain syncs with an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. The corp.fabrikam.com domain contains the organizational units (OUs) and custom Group Policy Objects (GPOs) shown in the following table. Fabrikam identifies the following planned changes: Create a single Azure subscription named Sub1 that will contain a single Azure virtual network named Vnet1. Replace the WAN links between the Seattle and New York offices by using Azure Virtual WAN and FxpressRoute. Both on premises offices will be connected to Vnet1 by using ExpressRoute. Create three Azure file shares named newyorkfiles, seattlefiles, and companyfiles. Create a domain controller named dc3.corp.fabrikam.com in Vnet1. Deploy an Azure Virtual Desktop host pool to Vnet1. The Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts will be hybrid Azure AD-joined. License all servers for Microsoft Defender for servers. Use Azure Policy to enforce configuration management policies on the servers in Azure and on-premises. Fabrikam identifies the following networking requirements: Implement Virtual WAN and ensure that all the network traffic between the sites uses Virtual WAN. All communications must occur over ExpressRoute. If a DHCP server fails, ensure that the client computers can continue to receive their dynamic IP address and renew their existing lease. Ensure that the resources in Vnet1 can resolve the names of the on-premises servers in the corp.fabrikam.com domain. Fabrikam identifies the following security requirements: Apply GPO4 to the Azure Virtual Desktop session hosts. Ensure that Azure Virtual Desktop user sessions lock after being idle for 10 minutes. Users must be able to control the lockout time manually from their client computer. Ensure that server administrators request approval before they can establish a Remote Desktop connection to an Azure virtual machine. If the request is approved, the connection must be established within two hours. Prevent user passwords from containing all or part of words that are based on the company name, such as Fab, f@br1kAm or fabr!|. Ensure that all instances of Webapp1 use the same service account. The password of the service account must change automatically every 30 days. Prevent domain controllers from directly contacting hosts on the internet. You need to configure the synchronization of Azure files to meet the following requirements: Ensure that seattlefiles syncs to FS2. Ensure that newyorkfiles syncs to FS1. Ensure that companyfiles syncs to both FS1 and FS2. You need to implement a name resolution solution that meets the networking requirements. Which two actions should you perform?",

The forest contains the users shown in the following table. The forest contains the groups shown in the following table. When an administrator signs in to the console of VM2 by using Virtual Machine Connection, and then disconnects from the session without signing out, another administrator can connect to the console session as the currently signed in user. Contoso identifies the following technical requirements: Change the replication schedule for all site links to 30 minutes. Promote Server1 to a domain controller in canada.contoso.com. Install and authorize Server3 as a DHCP server. Ensure that User1 can manage the membership of all the groups in Contoso\\OU3. Ensure that you can manage Server4 from Server1 by using PowerShell remoting. Ensure that you can run virtual machines on VM1. Force users to provide credentials when they connect to VM2.
